Pre and Post-procesisng scripts for random vacancies sampling

To prepare the problem run Set_samples.m, when prompted for merging files enter the max number of levels offered by the prompt. Generate also files for running on "farber" (UD cluster), it prepares the directory structure and input files for LEO2D into a .tar.gz file.

Potsprocessing is done by PostProc*.m files (DoS and CCCM), run the files *levels.m in the directory with the output *.bin files (typically ./out) Make sure that the file problem_definition.mat generated by Set_Samples.m is in the same directory.

For CCCM: use PostprocCCM.m (most recently updated)
