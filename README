LEO2D (Locality for Electronic Observables in Two-Dimensions):
An MPI + OpenMP tight-binding code for electronic structure in 2D materials

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
1) >> cp CMakeLists_templates.txt CMakeLists.txt
2) edit CMakeLists.txt options as desired
3) >> cmake .
4) >> make all

the application LEO2D will be placed in the app folder

TESTING:
The only up-to-date example input file is examples/tblg/tblg_hstruct.in
>> mpirun -n 2 app/LEO2D examples/tblg/tblg_hstruct.in
output will be written to bi_graphene001.cheb (DoS via KPM) and bi_graphene001_matrix.dat (sparse matrix format)
